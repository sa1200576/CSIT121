    <h1>This is my favorite cat and its name is the Burmese cat</h1>
    <p>This cat is pretty cool because when it is a kitten it kind of looks like simba from the lion king </p>
    <p>The Burmese cat comes from Burma and they have been around for about 200 years because they were bread from the cat called Wong Mau </p>
